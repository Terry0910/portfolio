        <h2 id="topic">My Life Before Web Developer</h2>
        <p>About 12 years ago i began my journey in music field.
            I was indulge more into the process of exploring my guitar techniques and jamming.
            It was like i was more into my process of learning more and more, even more doing practices,
            exploring artists of genre's like hard rock, classic rock, funk, blues, jazz etc.
            The most exiciting thing happen in my life was adapting my passion towards music.
            Before deeping my skills in music i was also curios to know and understand computers,
            so i pursued Computer Applicatioin in my collge days but was not into my learning because
            i was not showing interest in learning my subject. As i grewed more practicing and teaching music
            learing theories in music, playing with friends, jamming etc. I got my job in one of the IB
            (International Baccaluareate) school as Music Facilitator. But due to some curcumstances i had to quit
            my job and start searching for new. Then side by side i was known that the demand of Prograimming language
            in any field is at high.
            So for that i started learning from HTML and CSS.

        <h2 id="topic">My Journey as a Web Developer</h2>
        <p>
                About two months ago i started my journey as a web developer. I knew that this is the long process
                and i have to study even more because its a computer language but one thing i know was
                <em>"we can do anything, if we desired to acheive our goals".</em>
                I gathered inforamtion about steps to start learning from HTML and CSS,
                i downloaded some apps to learn and practice how coding works. I enrolled in a course
                to learn step by step.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Choose a specialty. As explained earlier, you can choose FrontEnd web development or BackEnd development and specialize. If you want to be a Full Stack developer, you should start with FrontEnd.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Acquire the needed programming language skill. Each web development specialty has the necessary programming languages that you should learn. This has been highlighted above.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take on small projects and create your online portfolio. You need to start small, take on small projects, complete them and move on to bigger ones. No need to rush, big and complex websites are built on simple principles you’d encounter in these small projects. As soon as you’ve learned some skills, go ahead and create a web page that features your work and experience. You should also use social media, as sites like Facebook and Twitter make it easy to show your skills, meet other coders, and find projects to work on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be very patient in testing and debugging. After you’re done writing those codes, ensure to test them. Also, as you debug the codes, do it patiently so that you’ll learn not to repeat errors as you take on bigger projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Join a web developers’ forum and interact. An active web developers’ community is good for you. You get to learn from others’ errors, judge others’ works, get informed on important updates and several other benefits. Social media sites and your favorite search engine are also very good to keep up to date with the latest news.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learn from other websites. Checking out websites that you find appealing is also a good way to become a professional. You can incorporate their codes into your projects to help you learn faster.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Practice! Practice!! Practice!!! Behind every successful website is hours of training and practice. You get better with repetition.
